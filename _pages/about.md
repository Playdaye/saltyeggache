I am working on Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), String Theories, and related topics of Mathematical Physics. My research is two-folded: On one hand, it is focused on the non-perturbative aspects of QFTs and string theories. On the other hand, I am curious in the underlying mathematical structures behind physics. My recent interests lies in understanding various defects and their non-perturbative features.
